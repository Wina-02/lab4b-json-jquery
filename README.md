# Lab 4B — JSON and jQuery

This project demonstrates how JSON data can be integrated with jQuery to create a simple, data-driven web page.  
It was developed as part of the **Client-Side Scripting** lab exercise to show how structured data can be parsed, displayed, and manipulated directly within the browser.
